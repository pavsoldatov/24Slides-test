It has all TODOs done, including the Annotations page with some minor post-interview fixes.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. `npm run concurrently` to kickstart both the fake server and the client (or launch dev mode with `npm run dev`)
3. The fake server has 350ms delay to emulate the server response. Look for `-d 350` flag inside package.json to change it.
